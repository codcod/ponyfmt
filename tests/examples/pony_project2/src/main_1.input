/*
Main program wiring for the example application.

This file constructs the gateways, router, processor and receiver
actors and starts a small HTTP server (see `web/server.pony`) that
accepts POST requests to create messages. It also contains a small
demo sequence that sends a few example messages to exercise the
pipeline.

This file is an executable entry point when compiled as a Pony
program; it intentionally performs only wiring and demos â€” the
application logic lives in other modules (`receiver.pony`,
`message.pony`, and the `gateways/` actors).
